# Makefile-Generator

That's a simple program that generates a prototype makefile for the files specified to get you up and running in an instant.
It's not something crazy but it might come in handy when you are starting a new project and save you some time.

In order to use it you must give the name that you whould like your executable to be and the source files. The program will add 
as dependencies the header files that you have included in your source code, so it's up to you to make sure that you've created 
the corresponding header files, so the generated makefile can be functional.
